X Education gets a lot of leads but its lead conversion rate is very poor 
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’
If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
We will help them to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. 
We are  required to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be 80%.
